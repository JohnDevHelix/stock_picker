Odin Project stock picker method takes an array of stock prices.
Created a method that will get the highest profit value and return the index of best days to buy and the best day to sell.
Created 2 blocks with each_with_index method. Used map to get difference for each nested array. Used max and find_index to get the index of the highest profit value.
